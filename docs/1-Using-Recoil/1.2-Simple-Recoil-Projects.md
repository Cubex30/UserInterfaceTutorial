To start our Recoil project, we need to import the `Recoil` Component.  This must be included in the root of any project.

```` TypeScript
import { Recoil } from '@cubex/recoil';
````

Next, let's create our `Root` Component.

```` TypeScript
export interface IRootProps {

}

export default class Root extends React.Component<IRootProps, any> {
    render () {
        return (
            <Recoil>
            </Recoil>
        );
    }
}
````
