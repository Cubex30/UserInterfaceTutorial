In order to unify our UI/UX designs, it is best to use a standard style and component library.  For our purposes, we will look at Recoil.

In order to install Recoil, we must configure our project to compile `.less` files.  LESS is a dynamic language for generating stylesheets, and it is heavily used by Recoil to define its styles.

In the console, run

    npm install css-loader less less-loader style-loader --save-dev

Then, we must update our `webpack.config.js` files.  If you're using the `ts-boilerplate` project, be sure to update both versions of the configuration.  In the `loaders` array, add

```` JavaScript
{
    test: /\.less$/,
    loader: 'style-loader!css-loader!less-loader'
}
````

We must now add Recoil.  In the console, run

    npm install @cubex/recoil

Now that we have recoil installed, we must reference the `.less` files.  In our `main.tsx`, include the line

```` TypeScript
import '@cubex/recoil/less/index.less';
````

This directly references the stylesheet to be compiled by Webpack.  Furthermore, we only need to reference the stylesheet here.

## Using Recoil in a View

We can now import Recoil components, which will be styled correctly.  For example, let's say we wish to use a `Button` in our component.  We can simply include

```` TypeScript
import { Button } from '@cubex/recoil';
````

And then in the body of the component, we can use it directly

```` TypeScript
render() {
    return (
        <Button>OK</Button>
    );
}
````
