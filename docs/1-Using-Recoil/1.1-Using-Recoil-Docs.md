Recoil contains many components which work together dynamically.  In order to get the most out of it, consider using its documentation directly.

To build Recoil's documentation, clone it from GitHub.

    git clone https://github.com/Cubex30/recoil.git

Then install the npm dependencies

    npm install

Then build the project

    npm run build

Then launch the documentation in your browser.  It should be located at `recoil/docs/index.html`.
