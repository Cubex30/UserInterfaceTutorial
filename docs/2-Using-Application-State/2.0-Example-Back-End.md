In order to develop our Single Page Application, we need to create a back-end service.  For consistency, we're going to use a Node.js server with `sierra`, an MVC framework.

Let's create a new project for our service.

First, we need to ensure Yeoman is installed

    npm install -g yo

Then we need to install our Yeoman generator for TypeScript

    npm install -g generator-typescript-project

Now we are ready to create our new project.  In our projects folder, we will create a directory `example-service`.

    mkdir example-service

Enter the new directory

    cd example-service

Now let's run our generator, and answer any prompts.

    yo typescript-project
